# No solace in béziers

Accomplished type designer Gerard Unger has explored improving practical aspects of a typeface through de-familiarisation. His process involves:

> investigating legibility, clarity, economy – and as much of that as possible, even to the extent of taking letterforms beyond conventionality. With Swift for example, during the first three years of its life, clients and readers saw its novelty; they noticed the experiment with large counters and angularity, and many found this disturbing.

For my grad project at Emily Carr, I’d like to design a type family that takes the angular characteristics in typefaces like Swift to an extreme. Can curves be eliminated entirely from a useful book serif; can they be inherit to its design?

## Research

This would involve research into:

- Many areas of type design, especially legibility in display faces
- Historical research into blackletter and other styles where angularity was prevalent
- Supporting extended basic latin, and how to test faces in languages I don’t speak

## Prototype

My first attempt at this was [a display face and promotional website](http://untitled.harp.io), completed in less than two months as part of Ross Milne’s type design class at Emily Carr University. With this project, I’d like to make this typeface work at smaller sizes, and expand it to at least six styles (heavy, regular, light, and an italic for each).
