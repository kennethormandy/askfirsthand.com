Two years ago, I worked on a project that would provide a platform for people to take a single picture everyday. I personally have tried to do this manually, but realized how difficult it was to maintain the habit. But I also realized this wasn’t an isolated issue with just taking daily photos. Journals are the same. Most habits can be hard to begin.

Rather than make taking a daily photo a chore, it should be fun.  It can also be a transformative experience. A moment that would otherwise be wasted killing time on a phone, could instead be injected with a moment of creativity. We see this in alternate reality games which aim to blend our real, physical world with an alternate reality. They can make something as mundane as mopping the floor into something fun, competitive, and social.

We can leverage the tools that we already have—our everyday devices—to experience the world around us in new ways. We can literally use our devices as the lenses in which we see the world.

I’ve wrestled with myself many times over in how to frame my research. Because I wanted to deal with photography, I extensively looked into the areas of memory, memory and decision-making, networked photography, diaries for education purposes, and storytelling which, at times, led me astray to think about other problems. However, the research from those tangents has still informed my thinking in one way or another.

In its current stage, my project revolves around an app that can automatically launch into a counting-down camera. It activates unsuspectingly once a day, interrupting moments when you’re using your device but aren’t doing anything important. I’m working with Ryan Wong, a software developer, to figure out the right set of criteria that can use contextual data to capture interesting pictures, as well as avoid interrupting tasks.

My suspicions are that random, spontaneous photographs won’t all be great, but they can still be meaningful, just as an old movie ticket holds value to the keeper of that souvenir. The images may also make more sense as a group of images, and the pictures can be delivered as a bundle towards the end of a week. On the process of developing film in an article titled [Goodbye, Cameras](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/goodbye-cameras) for <cite>The New Yorker</cite>, designer and writer Craig Mod writes,

Time can give us perspective, and this is true when we talk about creative work, but also for memories.

To investigate some of my suspicions, I put out a probe this week asking participants to take pictures once a day. They’ll receive a prompt from [Mind Jogger](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/mind-jogger/id409841508?mt=8), an app that can generate a custom notification at a random point throughout the day. Participants are then asked to immediately take a photo using [1-Hour Photo](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/1-hour-photo/id871725403?mt=8). I’m also participating in this experiment, and am looking forward to the results. I’m excited from what I’m going to learn from this experiment and the iterative testing to follow.
