Deciding on a topic for my grad project was possibly one of the most anxiety provoking (but exciting) experiences I’ve had so far at Emily Carr.

At the end of last spring semester, we were tasked with coming up with three ideas for our grad project over the summer. And then summer happened; I got sidetracked by sunshine, craft beers, a summer job, and obviously didn’t start really brainstorming until four days before classes started again.

When I finally put pen to paper, I was daunted with the infinitesimal choice of subject matter. This was my one chance to do my dream project, anything I wanted, an opportunity that probably won’t come around again for years to come.

I had not one solid idea. My brain felt both fried from too much sun and paralyzed by my greatest fear: that I would create something beautiful and completely irrelevant because it doesn’t address a human, cultural, or social need.

I realized that as a designer, I’ve never had to think of my own content or problem space to design for. This looming capstone project, however, forced me to take a deep, dark look inward. I had to figure out what I, Claire Carsley, actually care about, and what I want to contribute to the world through design.

Deep in my introspective daze, I started thinking about my feelings, which probably hasn’t happened since Foundation year. I faced my fears of irrelevance by ruminating over frustrating social issues and inequalities that design could potentially address. I needed to find a topic that sparked a fire in my belly that would fuel me through seven months of soul crushing (but fun) research and design.  

Though I didn’t quite get as far as internal combustion, wrestling with the emotional side of my brain did lead to an area that absolutely needs addressing: low voter turnout. With only half the population showing up to the polls, our democracy is completely ineffective. With some research, I narrowed it to _youth_ voter turnout, as only ⅓ young people in Canada actually vote.

Coincidentally, my desk neighbor and I came up with the identical project ideas. We joined forces, to tackle this giant, messy problem together. Hopefully, we will make something better than either one of us could have done alone.

Deciding on my own design problem to tackle was a valuable exercise to begin my final year of school with. It forced me to think about my values as a designer and what I want to contribute to the world once I am pushed out of the Emily Carr nest.
