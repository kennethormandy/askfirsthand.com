Hello there! My name is Victoria Lee and I’m a fourth year Communication design student at Emily Carr University of Art + Design. I was born with stage 2 primary lymphedema and intestinal lymphedema.

As I’ve grown up with both visible and invisible conditions, I’ve found that even with the support of my medical care team, close friends and family, my conditions have strongly affected me emotionally and mentally, especially in relation to my body image and appearance.I understand that I may not be the only one who has experienced emotional and mental stressors due to these conditions. Therefore, I’d like to help my community through the research and design of my thesis project.

My thesis project is called Lift and its purpose is to discover how we might improve the perceptions of people in their early 20s, diagnosed with stage 2 primary lymphedema, regarding their body image and appearance. To make the most out of my short timeframe, my project focuses on congenital and praecox lymphedema, two subcategories of primary lymphedema. Congenital lymphedema appears immediately from birth to 2 years old whereas, praecox lymphedema can appear anytime between 2-30 years old.

What is primary lymphedema? To give you a brief introduction, primary lymphedema is a rarely recognized, congenital chronic swelling in the upper and/or lower limb, and in rare cases, organs such as intestines. It is developed from a buildup of fluid and other tissue elements that have challenges draining through the lymphatic system. It not only causes physiologic problems but emotional and mental fatigue as well.

Many of these young people experience different levels of apprehension such as self-worth, anxiety, and embarrassment due to their unique experiences with lymphedema, especially in relation to the visibility of their swelling. As they continue to build identity and social relationships, and enter into the workforce, many feel too apprehensive to talk about their stressors relating to their lymphedema, and seek acceptance and protection from those even closest to them, such as their family and close friends. I’m hoping that my project will help these individuals overcome their perceptions about their body image and appearance in regards to the visibility of their swelling to improve their emotional and mental well-being.

Through rigorous research, I’ve found that the majority of articles (very few) relating to lymphedema are about the physical management of the swollen limbs and that there are scarcely any peer-reviewed articles and publications about the emotional and mental aspect of this condition. This is both a new challenge and opportunity for me to gather and contribute findings about emotional and mental aspects of primary lymphedema so that lymphedema gains global awareness and individuals affected by lymphedema can use this information as a source of inspiration.

I’m hoping that my thesis project will not only help these young people overcome their issues of body image and appearance, but also become a platform of knowledge and inspiration for those affected by and wishing to learn about the emotional and mental aspects of lymphedema.
